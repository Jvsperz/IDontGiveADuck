Change background of the game for better thematic coherence between the game and the duck theme

Add animations for waves or ripples before the ducks appear to allow them to be able to read the movements and anticipate where the ducks will spawn 

Add flashing timer to allow better information clarity for the player

Fix play area for the duck spawner and add audio cues when a duck spawns to make it more obvious to the player where they are about to appear so they can anticipate and react accordingly
