I don't give a duck analysis

Key assessments and research points:

1. Assess the effectiveness of click-based mechanics for player engagement
2. Analyse the game's potential for scaling from 12 levels to 100+ levels
3. Identify design strengths and limitations with supporting evidence
4. Consider accessibility, player psychology, and technical constraints (mobile)

Research Concepts to Guide Analysis:
• Click-Based Mechanics: Immediate Gratification Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, Motor
Accessibility, Input-Response Feedback Loops. Research industry examples: Candy Crush
Saga (match-3 clicking), Fruit Ninja (swipe-based timing), Cookie Clicker (incremental
clicking mechanics)
• Scalability Challenges: Content Scalability, Player Motivation Decay, Difficulty Curve
Mathematics, Player Fatigue. Compare approaches: Angry Birds (level-based
progression), Temple Run (endless scaling), Plants vs Zombies (difficulty ramping)
• Mechanical Depth: Interaction Design Constraints, Strategic Depth vs Accessibility, Skill
Ceiling Concepts. Analyse examples: Tetris (simple inputs, complex strategy), Flappy Bird
(minimal mechanics, high skill ceiling), Monument Valley (simple taps, spatial puzzles)
• Design Strengths: Instant Gratification Design, Thematic Coherence, Mobile Gaming
Context, Universal Design. Study successful examples: Pokémon GO (accessible AR
interactions), Among Us (simple social mechanics), Clash Royale (streamlined strategy)

Assessment Criteria:
• Demonstrates understanding of click-based interaction design principles
• Critically evaluates scalability challenges for 100+ level expansion
• Identifies specific strengths and limitations with clear reasoning
• Analyses mechanical depth constraints and opportunities
• Recognises genuine design limitations while considering expansion potential
• Uses appropriate game design terminology
• Supports arguments with examples from the design documents 

Instant gratification theory
"Immediate gratification" describes the human desire for instant pleasure or reward, preferring a smaller, sooner benefit over a larger, delayed one. This tendency, rooted in evolutionary survival instincts and reinforced by modern technology, can lead to impulsive behaviours, procrastination, and short-term thinking, but it also has potential benefits for motivation when balanced with long-term goals.

Ways to provide instant gratification 
- Display the players points when they click a decoy duck, bad duck or a good duck.

UI and interactive features
- Trying to build tension - timer makes the player panic trying to convey a sense of urgency

Cognitive load theory
- Cognitive Load Theory, developed by John Sweller, posits that human working memory has a limited capacity, making it easily overloaded by excessive or irrelevant information, which hinders learning.
- Minimal clt in the game

Ways to improve the game and cognitive load
- Make a negative or positive response more prominent for the user to guide them as a way to indicate progress - Particle effects, timer effects, sounds, shake effect, more sounds to form pattern recognition behaviours from the player
- Add animations to make the different features and effects more enhanced
- Introduce mechanics and make them more visible and make them more understandable 

Accessibility restrictions
- Make for a pc, think about users on tablets, phones
- Making the game easier for players with physical hindrances and allow them to be able to enjoy the experience

- Compare the game to other click based games and come up with other features, cookie clicker, fruit ninja, candy crush 

What to add
- Powerups to make the game more immersive
- Repetitive gameplay is boring
- Place checkpoints, leading to harder levels, saves progression
- Extra lives instead of checkpoints...?
- Possible changing of timer and scored based on how quickly the player completes the level
