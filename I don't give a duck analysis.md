I don't give a duck analysis



Key assessments and research points:



1\. Assess the effectiveness of click-based mechanics for player engagement

2\. Analyse the game's potential for scaling from 12 levels to 100+ levels

3\. Identify design strengths and limitations with supporting evidence

4\. Consider accessibility, player psychology, and technical constraints (mobile)



Research Concepts to Guide Analysis:

• Click-Based Mechanics: Immediate Gratification Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, Motor

Accessibility, Input-Response Feedback Loops. Research industry examples: Candy Crush

Saga (match-3 clicking), Fruit Ninja (swipe-based timing), Cookie Clicker (incremental

clicking mechanics)

• Scalability Challenges: Content Scalability, Player Motivation Decay, Difficulty Curve

Mathematics, Player Fatigue. Compare approaches: Angry Birds (level-based

progression), Temple Run (endless scaling), Plants vs Zombies (difficulty ramping)

• Mechanical Depth: Interaction Design Constraints, Strategic Depth vs Accessibility, Skill

Ceiling Concepts. Analyse examples: Tetris (simple inputs, complex strategy), Flappy Bird

(minimal mechanics, high skill ceiling), Monument Valley (simple taps, spatial puzzles)

• Design Strengths: Instant Gratification Design, Thematic Coherence, Mobile Gaming

Context, Universal Design. Study successful examples: Pokémon GO (accessible AR

interactions), Among Us (simple social mechanics), Clash Royale (streamlined strategy)



Assessment Criteria:

• Demonstrates understanding of click-based interaction design principles

• Critically evaluates scalability challenges for 100+ level expansion

• Identifies specific strengths and limitations with clear reasoning

• Analyses mechanical depth constraints and opportunities

• Recognises genuine design limitations while considering expansion potential

• Uses appropriate game design terminology

• Supports arguments with examples from the design documents

"Immediate gratification" describes the human desire for instant pleasure or reward, preferring a smaller, sooner benefit over a larger, delayed one. This tendency, rooted in evolutionary survival instincts and reinforced by modern technology, can lead to impulsive behaviours, procrastination, and short-term thinking, but it also has potential benefits for motivation when balanced with long-term goals.



Ways to provide instant gratification

* Display the players points when they click a decoy duck, bad duck or a good duck.



UI and interactive features

* Trying to build tension - timer makes the player panic trying to convey a sense of urgency

Cognitive Load Theory, developed by John Sweller, posits that human working memory has a limited capacity, making it easily overloaded by excessive or irrelevant information, which hinders learning.

\- Minimal (clt) in the game



Ways to improve the game and cognitive load

\- Make a negative or positive response more prominent for the user to guide them as a way to indicate progress - Particle effects, timer effects, sounds, shake effect, more sounds to form pattern recognition behaviours from the player

\- Add animations to make the different features and effects more enhanced

\- Introduce mechanics and make them more visible and make them more understandable



Accessibility restrictions

*  Make for a pc, think about users on tablets, phones
* Making the game easier for players with physical hindrances and allow them to be able to enjoy the experience
* Smaller screens, harder to click the ducks
* Could lead to frustration instead of enjoyment
* Not every phone is created equally



Compare the game to other click based games and come up with other features, cookie clicker, fruit ninja, candy crush



Scalability - Features that could be added to improve experience

*  Powerups to make the game more immersive
*  Repetitive gameplay is boring
*  Place checkpoints, leading to harder levels, saves progression
*  Extra lives instead of checkpoints...?
*  Possible changing of timer and scored based on how quickly the player completes the level

Player motivation decay in game design refers to a player's decreasing desire to play due to a drain on engagement, often caused by a lack of intrinsic reward, repetitive tasks, or excessive failure. Game designers combat this by focusing on psychological factors such as autonomy, competence, and relatedness, utilizing Self-Determination Theory, and carefully managing goals, challenges, and content to maintain long-term engagement and prevent burnout.

In game design, "player fatigue" can refer to two main concepts: a negative feeling of burnout and exhaustion from prolonged gameplay or a deliberate game mechanic designed to add strategic depth by limiting player actions over time. It's a nuanced concept that can be a game-breaker if implemented poorly, leading to player frustration, or a powerful tool if used effectively to create tactical choices and manage game length.



Cause of player fatigue and player motivation decay could be a cause of obvious factors from the game such as repetitive gameplay and challenges not being met to the player's skill set, this needs to be considered when designing any game to prevent factors that limit a game's scalability, accessibility, allow players to reach a flow state etc.

Game design mechanical depth refers to the range of meaningful, viable choices players have within a game's systems and rules, allowing them to solve problems and approach challenges creatively. It is distinct from complexity, which is the mental burden of understanding those rules and variables. A truly deep game offers many distinct possibilities arising from a simple ruleset, ensuring that no single strategy is consistently optimal and rewarding players for mastery and creative decision-making.

Design risks and flaws -

Lack of other mechanics - only clicking

Lack of meaningful games and goals

Reliance on the player not losing interest and lack of longevity

Risk of randomness as luck can both be positive and negative

Lack of end - some players could lose interest as some players may expect there to be some kind of ending and receive a sense of achievement or an abrupt ending after the final stage



What can be added to keep players after completing or during the game?

* Setting goals
* Adding story / a reason to continue playing to progress
